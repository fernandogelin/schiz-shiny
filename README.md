schiz-shiny app
===========
by Fernando Gelin

This app contains summary data obtained from exome analysis of schizophrenia cases. The R scripts used can be found in my R_scripts repo. Some of the scripts run when the app is launched and can be found in the /data folder. Folder /www contains html files generated from Rmd using knitr and are used by the app. server.R and ui.R have the code necessary to build the app. The app can be accessed at (https://fgelin.shinyapps.io/schiz-shiny/).
